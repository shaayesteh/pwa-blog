          A progressive web app (PWA) is an app that's built using web platform
          technologies, but that provides a user experience like that of a
          platform-specific app. Like a website, a PWA can run on multiple
          platforms and devices from a single codebase. Like a platform-specific
          app, it can be installed on the device, can operate while offline and
          in the background, and can integrate with the device and with other
          installed apps.
